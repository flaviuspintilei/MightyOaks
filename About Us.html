        <div class="description"> Mighty Oaks was formed in early 2010 by instrumentalists and vocalists Ian Hooper
            (United States), Claudio Donzelli (Italy), and Craig Saunders (United Kingdom).</div>
        <div class="description"> Hooper had moved to Hamburg after college some time before, and had befriended bassist
            Saunders when both were working on solo material as singer-songwriters.</div>
        <div class="description"> Several months later they met Donzelli at a small acoustic festival, and kept in touch
            afterwards. </div>

        <div class="description"> All three members had an interest in indie rock and folk rock, and together began
            focusing on guitar and instruments such as mandolin.</div>
        <div class="description"> The group self-released an EP on March 21, 2011, recording it themselves in Donzelli's
            apartment. Though never officially released on a label, the EP garnered several hundred thousand hits on
            SoundCloud.</div>
